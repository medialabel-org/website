Summary: Why focus on labeling of media?

Labeling media is a consensus policy to grapple with the accelerating use of deepfakes and other synthetic media as tools of disinformation. But passing legislation and then pursuing enforcement of that legislation over the course of the next several years, will leave us several years behind. Instead, we can implement direct image labeling in a common software component present in all computers and smartphones. This approach addresses media labeling in all media-sharing environments at once.
